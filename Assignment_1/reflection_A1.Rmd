assignment 1 take aways:

1) excel formatting and file basics
  a) don't use camelCase, use tiger_case
  b) command f and replace all " " with "_"
  c) use full find path, not wd. HARD CODE EVERYTHING
  
2) dplyr use
  a) apparently a$b<- a$b * a$d is not ok, use mutate()
  b) don't filter out by default, you want full data for all possible variables, even if this leads to weird conclusions.
  c) summary() should be used instead of dplyr for full stat calculations (even though its not dplyr)
  d) look up how to properly use group_by()
